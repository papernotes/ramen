            <h3>What does "aite" mean?</h3>
            <p>It's good, it's alright, but I won't seek it out. I won't mind eating here though</p>
            <h3>What does "yes" mean?</h3>
            <p>I'll say yes to going there every time</p>
            <h3>What does "try it" mean?</h3>
            <p>Try it out. There's something here that I liked but didn't make the "yes" category.</p>
            <h3>What does "nah" mean?</h3>
            <p>I'd prefer eating some place else.</p>
            <h3>Should I never eat at the "Nah" section?</h3>
            <p>No, you should still try it all. I'd be willing to "review" places again</p>
            <h3>How can you put RAMEN_PLACE in CATEGORY?!?</h3>
            <p>My bad, ignore that one</p>
